# List of podcasts I listen to

## Unthemed:

- **Programming Throwdown**  
  http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/  
  I enjoy the podcast because of personalities. Guys rarely make interviews but share a lot of their ideas and experiences. One of my favorites.

- **Software Engineering Radio**  
  http://www.se-radio.net/  
  Professional boring stuff. I skip a lot of shows but there are few that are golden. My favorite: [pat-kua-on-becoming-a-tech-lead](http://www.se-radio.net/2016/08/se-radio-episode-265-pat-kua-on-becoming-a-tech-lead/).

- **{CodingBlocks}.NET**  
  https://www.codingblocks.net/  
  Mostly about OOP practices on .NET/JavaScript stack. While I professionally disagree with a lot of things I find the show to be worth listening. Again, really fun personalities.

- **THE HANSELMINUTES PODCAST**  
  http://hanselminutes.com/  
  [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) is an amazing host. The show has the right balance of being entertaining and informative. 

- **.NET Rocks**  
  https://www.dotnetrocks.com/  
  .Net and JavaScript (a little bit) themed. Simply my favorite podcast. The hosts are super fun and knowledgeable. Mostly interviews.

- **MS Dev Show**  
  http://msdevshow.com/  
  Mostly about Microsoft technologies (obvs). Fun and informative.

- **Herding code**  
  http://herdingcode.com/  
  A lot of great content touching different topics (mostly interviews). Unfortunately, they don't post all that often nowadays.


## Web technologies:

- **Adventures in Angular**  
  https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular  
  Angular specific. A lot of great information. Although don't really enjoy the style.

- **NodeUp**  
  http://nodeup.com/  
  Podcast about Node.js. I do enjoy the show atmosphere. Recent series of 1:1 are golden, it seems that you see the products behind the scenes.

- **JavaScript jabber**  
  https://devchat.tv/js-jabber
  Recent addition. Great content so far.

  Not impressed. But decided to listen to a couple more. I'm working on Office 365 after all.
